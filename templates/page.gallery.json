The client asked for a modern take on the retro kitchen, something cool and funky to complement the house and the area. The Mint interiors in-house design team worked closely with the client to design this delightful space, their pastel hues balanced by the crisp-white Corian benchtop. Small details such as the rounded corner shelves under the the bench stir memories of grandma’s kitchen, while the freestanding oven range warms this modern room with echoes of the past. Underneath the retro looks are the best of modern appliances and fittings. In every way, this kitchen masters a mix of old and new to create a stylish and inviting space.<\/p>",

Available in a range of dynamic colours to suit any personality or kitchen, the colour panels can be converted to suit any personality or kitchen, the colour panels can be converted back to stainless steel at a later stage, so resale considerations won’t stop you from expressing your true colours.<\/p><p>There are three oven models available: 90cm, 60cm and a 60cm double oven with pizza oven. All offer a high-grade stainless-steel interior and, for easy cleaning,removable internal panels to the sides, rear and base. All Steel ovens are multifunctional and feature two unique combi-steam functions: static steam (no fan)and fan-forced steam. A water reserve in the base of the oven creates steam for use during the cooking process. Combi-steam cooking saves cooking time, keeps the flavour in the food and is healthier than standard cooking as fat or oil is not necessary. Using heat and steam at the same time means that when you roast, the meat is not only juicy but also still crispy and brown.<\/p>",
